## UNID-SYSTEM

This is the README file for Unid-System 1.0.1.


Unid system represnt a mini operating system made in C language, using dynamic programming. 
This system has its own shell for interpreting commands. Thus a user can work with files 
and directories on the command line.Thus, certain tasks can be automated and become much more efficient.
The system also offers various tools needed by any user and a series of games.

Download and Test:
```
https://github.com/dinuionica/Unid-system.git
```


On Linux:

```
$ make && ./unid_system
```

On Mac:

```
$ open unid_system.c
```

The command line interface is quite intuitive, the user will have to enter commands 
that the shell will interpret and execute. The use of dynamic programming gives a plus
to this project because the execution is very fast and the memory is dislocated at the end.

A summary of a few commands:
```
ls [path] -> to list of file and directories of a path
cd [path] -> to cd a path
rmf [filename] -> to delete a file
rmd [directoryname] -> to delete a directory

```

## A bit of history

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
